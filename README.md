# Everspin

This is the code for the Everspin mindfullness wheel. To use the program run the main.py file. This will launch the GUI which has a button labeled 'move' which calls the functions in motor.py to rotate the motors. Right not these functions do not do anything becasue the code has not yet been tested on a Raspberry Pi.

The motor.py file is the driver for the stepper motors. It contains functions for rotating clockwise and counter clockwise.

The light.py file is the driver for the RGB LEDs. There are functions for turning the lights red, green, blue, and off.
